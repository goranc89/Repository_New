    <h3>Remarks</h3>
    <p>The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks.
     He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name;
      he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to "simpleton".[4] The shorts became a part of The Tracey
       Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became 
       Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989â€“1990).</p><br>
    
    <h3>Caution</h3>
    <p>The main characters are the Simpson family, who live in a fictional "Middle America" town of Springfield.
     Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with
     his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Bouvier, a stereotypical American housewife and mother.
     They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old
     activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier.
     Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other 
     and they are often shown to care about one another.</p><br>
