// Variable declaration and initialization
// 1. Create several variables using different letter cases and beginning characters.
// Check if they still exist if you refer to them in different case - does case matter here?
// Try to declare a variable starting with number as the first character.
// 2. Save a string (text) describing your current mood in a variable and print it out in console.
// 3. Feel free to play around in the console and get familiar with it.
