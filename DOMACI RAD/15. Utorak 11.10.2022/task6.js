// 6. This one will continue on task 5. Create one more variable (or input field) and compare it with your age.
//  Show how much is that older/younger than you with text for example “He/She is 13 years older/younger than me”.
//   If you are the same age - print that you are the same age.

    else if(y>x)

    console.log("You are "+(y-x)+" years older than me!");
    }
    else
    {
    console.log("We are the same age!");
