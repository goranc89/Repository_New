// 5. Write a program to show you age based on entered number 
// (if you know how to create input field, if not create variable and give it a value). 
// If your age is 18 or older - print “You are old enough to drive”, but if not than print
//  how many years you need to turn 18.
//  If your age is greater than 18 - try one example with 13.
